To make this easier for you to understand i have uploaded a vedio tutorial of how to use this system , here is the link for the vedio in youtube:


Also this is system consists of two interfaces :

### Interface One

* This interface shows you the customer search bar 
* Then you can search the customer by name and there will appear a table including customer details , 
* Secondly , you will see only the customer details , but at the end of each raw there will be seperate links for the contact and activities as well 
* If you go each link, then you will be able to view contacts table and the activity table too. 

### Interface Two

* This interface consists of all the editing forms of above three categories , which are customer, contact and activities.
* At the end of each raw in each table , there will be an edit button , this button will lead you to second interface which are edit sections of each table .
